You can download the caprice32 original source code [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/caprice32/)

* This core also use some code from [wiituka/pituka](http://code.google.com/p/wiituka/) (c) 2004-2016 David Colmenero
* CPC464+/CPC6128+/GX4000 (c) 2016-2019 Colin Pitrat : https://github.com/ColinPitrat/caprice32
* Part of the autorun fixes (see catalog/amsdos_catalog and format.c) are inspired on the great work of Frédéric Coste (Fredouille) on [caprice-forever](https://www.cpc-power.com/cpcarchives/index.php?page=articles&num=445).

And of course for the RetroArch/Libretro team : "http://www.libretro.com"

The core works pretty well and give the fantastic ability to use the RetroArch Shaders.

Try some CRT shaders and welcome back to the 80s on your good old CPC.

## Usage

## Game Database

Our game database is based on [clean-cpc-db](https://github.com/clean-cpc-db). A database that [has checked every game](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-cap32/issues/112) so that you don't have to spend whole day of finding the correct and functional version of your favorite game. In clean-cpc-db you'll find **only clean versions with no weird intros or menus, just working games!**

Due to the creation of this database, we have started a small game mapping project, to bring an easyest CPC plug and play experiencie! You can help us...

* [Contribute with your RMP files](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-cap32/wiki/%5Bcolaborate%5D-create-a-new-RMP-for-your-favorite-game!) ([Work in Progress](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-cap32/wiki/RMP:-Done)).

When a game is detected as a **clean version**, a green disc icon appears at the bottom.
